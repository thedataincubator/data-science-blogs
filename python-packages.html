<h1>Ranking Popular Python Packages for Data Science</h1>

<p>At <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator</a>, we pride ourselves
on having the latest data science curriculum.  Much of our curriculum is based
on feedback from corporate and government partners about the technologies they
are looking to learn.  However, we wanted to develop a more data-driven
approach to what we should be teaching in
our
<a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/training.html">data science corporate training</a> and
our <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html">free fellowship</a> for
masters and PhDs looking to enter data science careers in industry.  Here are
the results.</p>

<h1>The Rankings</h1>

<p>Below is a ranking of Python packages that are useful for Data Science, based
on Github and Stack Overflow activity, as well
as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI (The Python Package Index)</a> downloads.</p>

<p>The table shows standardized scores, where a value of 1 means one standard
deviation above average (average = score of 0). For example, <code>numpy</code> is 2
standard deviations above average in Stack Overflow activity, while
<code>tensorflow</code> is close to average. See <a href="#Methods">below for methods</a>.</p>

<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>

<h2><code>numpy</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>, and <code>pandas</code> are top 3</h2>

<p>Due to massive total downloads and strong Stack Overflow activity, the clear
leader is <code>numpy</code> (a fundamental package for scientific computing with
Python).</p>

<p>However, the scalable machine learning package <code>tensorflow</code> (stared at Google)
trounces the other libraries in Github activity (based on both stars and
forks), with the more general machine learning module <code>scikit-learn</code> a distant
second, but fifth overall.</p>

<p>Both <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> (high-performance data structures and data analysis
package) are only average on Github, but strong in the other two categories.</p>

<p>The interactive interpreter <code>ipython</code> is fourth overall, while the <code>jupyter</code>
project (of the popular notebook) is 19th overall (not shown).</p>

the <a href="output/python-data-wide.csv">raw data is here</a>.</p>

<h2>Github vs. Stack Overflow activity</h2>

<p>There appears to be an inverse correlation in Github activity compared to Stack
Overflow and Downloads for the top packages. For example, there are a lot of
Stack Overflow questions for <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> compared to <code>tensorflow</code> and
<code>scikit-learn</code>, but the latter two have an edge on Github. Since <code>numpy</code> and
<code>pandas</code> are two "utility" packages, perhaps more people are actually using
them (and need help).</p>

<h2><code>numpy</code> most popular core library (beats <code>pandas</code>, <code>scipy</code>)</h2>

<p>Among the core libraries, <code>numpy</code> is a clear first, with <code>pandas</code> third,
<code>ipython</code> fourth, and <code>scipy</code> (an ecosystem of open-source software for
mathematics, science, and engineering) ninth.</p>

<h2><code>tensorflow</code> outperforms <code>theano</code> in Neural Networks</h2>

<p>The other deep-learning package, <code>Theano</code>, is a big distance behind
<code>tensorflow</code> in this ranking. The interactive and
polished <a href="http://playground.tensorflow.org">Tensorflow Playground</a> could be a
factor.</p>

<h2><code>matplotlib</code> most popular graphics library</h2>

<p>As expected, <code>matplotlib</code> (2D plotting library) is the most popular graphics
package, but the ranking also features <code>plotly</code> (interactive,
publication-quality graphs that can be easily published online) and <code>bokeh</code> (an
interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for
presentation). <code>ggpy</code> (Python port for R's popular <code>ggplot2</code> package) was 18th
overall, but the data is less reliable, as noted in the next section.</p>

<h1>Limitations</h1>

<p>As
with <a href="https://twitter.com/benhamner/status/732392995610198016">any analysis</a>,
decisions were made along the way. All source code and data is on <a href="https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs">our Github Page</a>.</p>

<p>First, our list of packages was <a href="#Methods">pre-selected</a>. </p>

<p>The full list of machine learning packages <a href="#Methods">came from a few sources</a>,
and a few packages were unranked, due to unavailable downloads or Github
data. These are: <code>basemap</code> (mapping with <code>matplotlib</code>), <code>d3py</code> (D3-like
plotting), <code>jupyter-notebook</code>, <code>mlpy</code> (machine learning based on <code>scipy</code> and
<code>numpy</code>), <code>pylearn2</code> (machine learning, based on <code>theano</code>), <code>pytables</code> (big
tables), and <code>shogun</code> (machine learning). They were all below average compared
to the ranked packages, in all categories.</p>

<p>Importantly,
the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview">Anaconda distribution</a> bundles
together many of these packages, and this was not considered.</p>

<p>Further, naturally, some packages that have been around longer will have higher
metrics, and therefore higher ranking. This is not adjusted for in any way.</p>

<p>The data presented a few difficulties:</p>

<ul>
<li>The python port for <code>ggplot</code> was recently renamed to <code>ggpy</code>, and we used the
latter for all metrics, except downloads (which used <code>ggplot</code>).</li>
<li><code>ipython notebook</code> is now <code>jupyter notebook</code>. Stack overflow auto-corrected
<code>ipython-notebook</code> to <code>jupyter-notebook</code> so we combined these results with
<code>jupyter-notebook</code> results from the other two sources. But <code>jupyter-notebook</code>
didn't have a downloads count, so it doesn't feature in the final
ranking. Instead, we also performed analyses for <code>ipython</code> and <code>jupyter</code>
individually, which do appear in the ranking.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/clips/pattern">Pattern package</a> has inflated Stack
Overflow (SO) question metrics since it's a common word. It has no tags data,
as SO auto-corrects the query "[pattern]" to something unrelated.</li>
<li>SO data for <code>plotly</code> may also be inflated, as it's both an R and Python
package.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methods</h1>

<p>All source code and data is on <a href="https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs">our Github Page</a>.</p>

<p>We first generated a list of Data Science packages
from
<a href="https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/resources/python_data_libraries.md">these</a> <a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/15-python-libraries-data-science/">three</a> <a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/9-python-analytics-libraries-1">sources</a>,
and then collected metrics for all of them, to come up with the ranking.</p>

<p>Github data is based on both stars and forks, while Stack Overflow data is based
on tags and questions containing the package name. Downloads are from PyPI,
using
a <a href="https://github.com/pavopax/vanity">fork of the <code>vanity</code> project</a>. Other
projects to get download counts
include <a href="https://github.com/jantman/pypi-download-stats">pypi-download-stats</a>
(couldn't get it to work)
and <a href="http://pypi-ranking.info/alltime">pypi-ranking.info</a> (gives smaller
numbers than <code>vanity</code>).</p>

<p><code>sqlite3</code> was removed from analysis, as it is a base Python module.</p>

<p><code>ggplot</code> downloads were combined with <code>ggpy</code> results from Github and Stack
Overflow.</p>

<p>Any unavailable Stack Overflow counts were converted to zero count.</p>

<p>Counts were standardized to mean 0 and deviation 1, and then averaged to get
Github and Stack Overflow scores, and, combined with the Downloads, the Overall
score.</p>

<p>Some manual checks were done to confirm Github repository location.</p>

<p>All data was downloaded on January 26, 2017.</p>
